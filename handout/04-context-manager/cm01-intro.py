# Python context managers - intro
# =============================================================================
#
# Pythonâ€™s with statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined
# by a context manager.
#
# This is implemented using a pair of methods that allow user-defined classes
# to define a runtime context that is entered before the statement body is
# executed and exited when the statement ends.
